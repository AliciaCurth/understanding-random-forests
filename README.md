# Understanding Random Forests as Self-Regularizing Smoothers
This repo contains code to replicate the experiments in the paper "Why do Random Forests Work? Understanding Tree Ensembles as Self-Regularizing Adaptive Smoothers" (Curth, Jeffares & van der Schaar, 2024, [link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01502)).

All experiments in the main text can be replicated using the code in the notebook ```replicate_experiments_sim.ipynb```, all experiments using real data in the appendix can be replicated using the code in the notebook ```replicate_experiments_real.ipynb```.
